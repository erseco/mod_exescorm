This files describes API changes in the mod_exescorm code.

=== 4.0 ===
* Setting 'displayactivityname' has been removed from exescorm. This will be handled by activityheader and is theme dependent.

=== 3.6 ===

* The following renamed classes have been completely removed:
  - exescorm_default_report (now: mod_exescorm\report)

=== 3.5 ===
* In get_exescorms_by_courses() external/ws function, the force new attempt setting is no longer a boolean - now accepts 3
  values: No (0), On complete (1) and the new Always (2). See MDL-32585 for more details.

=== 3.3.2 ===

* exescorm_refresh_events() Now takes two additional parameters to refine the update to a specific instance. This function
  now optionally takes the module instance object or ID, and the course module object or ID. Please try to send the full
  objects instead of the ids to save DB calls.

=== 3.1 ===
* Group and groupings support has now been enabled.

=== 3.0 ===

* External function mod_exescorm_external::get_exescorms_by_courses returned parameter "name" has been changed to PARAM_RAW,
  this is because the new external_format_string function may return raw data if the global moodlewssettingraw parameter is used.
* Function exescorm_view_display was renamed to exescorm_print_launch to avoid
  confussion with new function exescorm_view.

=== 2.8 ===

* Coding style fixes. A large number of coding style issues were fixed in MDL-45887. This means any local modifications
 to mod_exescorm are likely to conflict.

* All exescorm report plugins should use namespaced classnames now. Refer MDL-46469 for details.
